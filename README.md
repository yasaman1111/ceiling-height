Children’s Ceiling Height Perception – VR-Based ML App
This project explores how children between the ages of 6 and 8 perceive ceiling height in various indoor environments. The data originates from virtual reality (VR) experiments in which children interacted with different room types and were asked to describe how high the ceilings felt to them.

The outcome of this research is an interactive web application that uses machine learning to estimate children’s perception of height based on the type of room and its ceiling height. The aim is to support designers and architects in creating spaces that are more aligned with the psychological comfort and spatial perception of young users.

Project Objectives
Understand how ceiling height affects spatial perception in children.

Translate behavioral responses from VR experiments into machine-interpretable data.

Use predictive modeling to anticipate how a given spatial setup might be perceived.

Provide a tool that supports child-friendly architectural design.

Application Features
Simple user interface for selecting room type and ceiling height.

Visual feedback showing the likelihood of different perceptual responses (e.g. “Too Low”, “Tall”, etc.).

Based on real data collected from controlled VR experiments.

Intended as both a design aid and a research prototype.

Data Summary
The dataset includes responses from a series of VR simulations across five room types (Living Room, Kitchen, Multipurpose, Bathroom, and Storage), with varied ceiling heights. Each child’s perception was categorized into one of four levels: Very Short, Short, Tall, and Very Tall.

Use Cases
Architects designing for kindergartens or children’s hospitals.

Environmental psychologists studying spatial cognition.

Students or researchers interested in child-centered design and immersive technologies.

Notes
This project is a research-based prototype and should be interpreted in the context of its original study scope. Future versions may include more age groups, additional spatial variables (such as lighting or wall color), and expanded behavioral data.
